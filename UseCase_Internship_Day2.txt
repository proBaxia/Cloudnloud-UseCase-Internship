  Application Load Balancer 
  ==========================
> Distribute incoming traffic across attached EC2 instance across AZ

> Highiy available and scalable 

> Supports protocols like HTTP,HTTPS,TCP,SSL(termination)

> Receivies Public DNS Canonical name (CNAME) for endpoint 

> Performs instance health checks 

> Supports vatious routing - Round Robin,Path based, Host Based
       
STEPS- PART 1
--------------
> Create a VPC,2pubblic Subnets and 2 Private subnets in different AZs

    vpc IPv4 CIDR 10.10.0.0/16
    public  subnets CIDR 10.10.1.0/24
	public  subnets CIDR 10.10.2.0/24
    Private subnets CIDR 10.10.3.0/24
	Private subnets CIDR 10.10.4.0/24
	
> Launch 2 EC2 instances in 2 Private subnetsfrom preconfigured AMIs
   . in security group allow porth 80 for vpc CIDR 
   
> Create EC2 Target group and add these 2 EC2 instances into target group  
   . Configure target as port 80 and health check at /index.html
   
> Create Application Load balancer
   . Use 2 public subnetsto launch ALB   
   . Configure listener at port 80 
   . Configure security group and allow port 80 from anywhere
   . Attach to Target group create above 
   . Wait for instances to be Healthy in given target group
 
. GET THE LOAD BALANCER DNS AND TRY TO ACCESS OVER INTERNET WEB 

STEPS- Path2 - Enable Stickiness
--------------------------------
> Go to Target group
> Edit Attributes 
> Enable Stickiness with Stickiness duration of 30 secs
> Now try to hit the load balancer DNS again
> Refresh the page multiple times -> you should see same web page due to session stickiness 

STEPS - Path 3 - ALB custom Domain 
-----------------------------------
> Go to AWS Route53 (assuming you have your own Domain name purchased already.
 in orther to see how to redirect DNS from say godaddy to AWS Route53,
 refer Hosting website on s3 with custom domain name session )
 
> In Public hosted zone for your domain, create A record of type Alias and point
  it to ALB 

> Wait for 1-5 minutes 

> Now try to access your domain URL. you should be able to access the same web
  pages being served by Load Balancer 
  
STEPS- Path 4 - ALB serving HTTPS traffic 
> Add a HTTPS listener to ALB 
> While configuring Https listener,get the SSl Certificate From Amazon Certificate
  manager (you must own domain name to validate the certificate) 
> Deploy Certificateon ALB for HTTPS listener
> Forward the traffic to same Target group createfor HTTP traffic 
> Modify ALB security group and allow traffic for HTTPS (443)
> Access web application using https://your-domain-name
