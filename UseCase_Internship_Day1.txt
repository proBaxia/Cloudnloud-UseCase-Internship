1st month current user = 10000 request      90kb * 10000 = 90000
3rd month user         = 70000 request      90kb * 70000 = 6300000

To achive this how many vm you need 
1) utilazation 
2) number of request
3) pick time hour

90kb per page 

page (90kb) * 1st month request (10000) = 90000 user request
page (90kb) * 3rd month request (70000) = 6300000 user request

70000 request are coming at a time we need to define some approximate the 
Disk, network plus Application Perfomance and Application location has to
be consider . 
when we try 201 request on 1cpu and 1 MGB the server virtual machine(VM) crash so we need to upgrade our Cpu and MGB 
to 2cpu and 2 MGB we will upgrade it till will get 70000 request 

70000 request are coming at a time how many VM will you create 


 walmart.com | request | cpu | memory- GB|          VM
 90kb        | 200     |  1  |   1       |200*90 = 18000 is stable for 200 request for 1 cpu and 1 MGB
 90kb        | 430     |  2  |   2       |430*90 = 38700 is stable for 430 request for 2 cpu and 2 MGB     |
 90kb        | 600     |  3  |   3       |600*90 = 54000 is stable for 600 request for 3 cpu and 3 MGB 
 90Kb        | 1000    |  20 |   20      |1000*90 = 900000 is stable for 1000 request for 20 cpu and 20 MGB
 90kb        | 70000   |  75 |   75      |70000*90 = 63000000 is stable for 7000 request for 75 cpu and 75 MGB
 
 70000 request are coming at a time how many VM will you create
                  cpu     | memory | no of VM
minimum    t2 micro  1   |   1    |    20
           t2large   2   |   4    |    10
		   t2xlarge	 4   |   16   |    5 
			
			
maximum	    t2 micro 1   |    1   |    75
            t2xlarge 4   |    16  |    19
 
we can use this minimum 20vm and maximum 75vm to create an (autoscaling group). "20vm" will control the request of
"90000" kb and the "75vm" will control the request of "63000000 kb"

your Boss ask you to create 100vm . whqt will you ask him ?
how many .Production  servers  up all time  
         .Development servers  once in 2 to 3 months		 
		 .Monitoring  servers  up all time 
		 .Backup      servers  maybe daily 12am to 7am,weekly,once in a month depend on the project
		 .Paching     servers  Avalible when needed
