RPO > Recovery Point Objective is specifiically about data in orther to maintain
conitinuity. it is essential to derterming how often a business should schedule 
data backup on their network. RPO >  means how quickly you can avoid data loss 

RTO > Recovery Time Objective is how long it will take an organazation to get back 
up and runnung to the Recovery Point Objective. RTO >  means high availability how 
quick you can restore your business


NFR 

Customer used to give these RTO/RPO expectations in NFR (Non Functionnal requirements) document.
As an infrastructure person we should review and understand the business needs.Normally
NFR document contains the business expectations.in orther to achieve those business expectation
what necessary infrastructure required is our call to plan end across the platform 

 Functional Requirements Example
---------------------------------
1) Authenticate of user whenever he/she logs ito the system.
2) system shuown incase of cyber attack.
3) A verification email is sent to user  wheneverhe/she registers foe the first time on some system.
4) only Mangerial level employees have right to view revenue data.
5) The software system should be integrated with banking app API 
6) The software system should pass Section 508 accessibility requirement.

NON Functional Requirements Example
------------------------------------
1) Emails Should be sent with a latentcy of no greater than 12 hours from such an
 activity.

2) The processing of each request should be done with 10 secondss.

3) The site should load in 3 seconds when the number of simultaneous user are > 10000


4) Users must change the initially assinged login password immediately after successful
  login.

5) Employees never allowed to update their salary information.Such attempt should
  be reported to the security adminstrator.

6) Ever unsucessessful attempt by user to access an item of data shall be recorded on audit trail.
A website should be capable enough to hanndle 20 million users with affecting its performance 
tThe software should portable . so moving from one OS to other OS does create any problem .
Privacy of information,the export of restricted technologies , intellectual property right,etc shouldbe audited.

Public Cloud:

Definition: In a public cloud, computing resources (such as servers, storage, and applications) are owned and operated
by a third-party cloud service provider and are made available to the general public or a large industry group.

Key Characteristics:
********************
Accessibility: Services are available to anyone on the internet.
Shared Resources: Resources are shared among multiple customers, leading to cost savings.
Scalability: Easily scalable to accommodate varying workloads.
Examples: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Private Cloud:
---------------
Definition: In a private cloud, computing resources are used exclusively by a single business or organization. 
The infrastructure can be physically located on-premises (on-site) or hosted by a third-party provider.

Key Characteristics:
********************
Dedicated Resources: Resources are exclusively used by a single organization.

Control: Offers greater control over security and customization.

Scalability: Can be less scalable than public clouds but offers more control over scalability.
Examples: On-premises data centers, dedicated hosting environments.

Hybrid Cloud:
-------------
Definition: A hybrid cloud is a combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared
between them. It provides greater flexibility and more deployment options.

Key Characteristics:
********************
Integration: Enables the seamless integration of on-premises infrastructure with public cloud services.

Data Portability: Allows data and applications to move between public and private environments.

Flexibility: Provides flexibility in choosing where to run specific workloads based on requirements.

Examples: Organizations might use a private cloud for sensitive workloads and a public cloud for scalable tasks or backup.

Considerations:
***************
Security: Private clouds offer more control over security, while public clouds leverage the security measures provided by
the service provider.

Cost: Public clouds often provide cost advantages due to shared resources, while private clouds may be more cost-effective for
certain workloads or when compliance requirements demand dedicated resources.

Flexibility: Hybrid clouds provide a balance of flexibility and control, allowing organizations to choose the best environment
for each workload.

The choice between public, private, or hybrid cloud depends on factors such as data sensitivity, regulatory compliance,
scalability needs, and budget considerations for a particular organization.
